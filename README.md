# Caduceus - Project 1

## Overview

Caduceus is a single pair ethernet (803.2bg) board that uses a basic SAMD51 microcontroller for basic sensory and automation. The goals of the board are to allow for a 100Mbps ethernet link as well as power over a single pair of wires connected to a processor which is relatively low power, and can use SIMD instructions.
