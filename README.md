# Caduceus - Project 1

## Overview

Caduceus is a single pair ethernet (803.2bw) board that uses a basic SAMD51 microcontroller for basic sensory and automation. The goals of the board are to allow for a 100Mbps ethernet link as well as power over a single pair of wires connected to a processor which is relatively low power, and can use SIMD instructions.

**This is the first group project of the ["Internet of Things" discord](https://discord.gg/KGtvTYx)**

For the power delivery aspect of the project, the design will use TIs design guide [TIDA-010076](https://discord.gg/KGtvTYx) which 

Example uses for the PCB-

* Wireless gateway
* Sensors
* Automation
* Edge ML
* SPE Experimentation
